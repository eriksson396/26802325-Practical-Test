\newpage

```{r}
gg <- cases_per_region(continents,  xaxis_size = 5, xaxis_rows = 3)
gg
```
We can see that as of this week Africa had by far the fewest total cases compared to the other continents in the dataframe. Less than 15 Million COVID cases



```{r}
ggg <- deaths_per_region(continents,  xaxis_size = 5, xaxis_rows = 3)
ggg
```
We can further see that this is also reflected in the deaths per region Africa is the only continent with less than 500,000 deaths related to COvid while all other continents had at least 1 Million so far.


```{r}
summary(owid_data$female_smokers)
summary(owid_data$aged_65_older)
```


First, of all we not that theere is very little data on ICU admissions and patients since the vast majority is NA's as the summary command shows.

```{r}
# <- owid_data[owid_data$iso_code %in% c("OWID_AFR", "OWID_ASI", "OWID_EUR", "OWID_NAM", "OWID_SAM"),] 
#no data available for OWID continents...
###add lagged ICU admissions
summary(owid_data$icu_patients) 
summary(owid_data$weekly_icu_admissions_per_million)
unique(owid_data$icu_patients)

##regressions does not work
#regressions <- lm(formuala = lagged_ICU_patients ~ hospital_beds_per_thousand, data = owid_data)
```




# Overview



For the following, I used my discretion and added some further insight into the fruit referncing exercise. This could've been a plot, but let's practice referencing in text.

Spanish wines have far greater references to fruit, at `r round(N_Refs_Fruit_spain*100, 3)`%  of references mentioning fruits, compared to 
`r round(N_Refs_Fruit*100, 2)`% of reviews for `r glue::glue_collapse( CountryList[!grepl("Spain", CountryList)], sep = ", ", last = " and ")`.

### Referencing certain terms
