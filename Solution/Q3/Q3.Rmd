# Overview.


The great function \textit{Data Collating} does not work for the whole data folder due to the error message: "Error in `bind_rows()`:
! Can't combine `winner_seed` <double> and `winner_seed` <character>.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred."

Therefore, I tried to apply to parts of the csv files that may have a similar internal structure. Indeed, it works for the ranking files which also have a player id variable. The player csv file, which contains more than 50.000 tennis players with id's can then be merged with the ranking, which I did.



```{r}
library(stargazer)

playerranking |> select(height, hand, ioc)|> stargazer(type = "text")
```
The average height of all players (ca. 1mio different tennis players) in the data frame is 1.8398m. The smallest is 1.45m and the tallest is 2.11m.

```{r}
library(stargazer)

atp_matches_2022 |> select(winner_ht)|> stargazer(type = "text")
```

```{r}
#rename matching variable
atp_matches_2022 <- rename(atp_matches_2022, player_id = winner_id)

comparison_winners_2022 <- merge(playerranking,atp_matches_2022,by="player_id")

#comparison_loosers_2022 <- merge(playerranking, atp_matches_2022)
```
I read in the data of atp matches 2022 and was able to merge the player id with my "playerranking" dataframe. With this one could compare characteristics of successful tennis players.

```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Relationship between height and rank of a tennis player.\\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
#make lineplot of height and rank

g <-
  tennis_success(playerranking, xaxis_size = 5, xaxis_rows = 3)
    
g
```
